# Basketball-AI-Analytics
This project implements a real-time computer vision pipeline designed to analyze basketball shooting mechanics. By combining deep learning-based object detection with classical physics modeling, the system tracks the ball's flight path and predicts the likelihood of a successful shot before the ball reaches the hoop.
